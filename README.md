# Python-Instacart

Data Analysis Project completed using Python and Excel

### Objective

Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app, already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales platform.  My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for leveraging different variables to increase overall profitability.
